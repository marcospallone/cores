    "garden_text1": "The Garden Hotel represents a unique opportunity in the heart of Abruzzo: a historic accommodation facility, well distributed and ready to be relaunched or transformed according to new needs. <br></br><br></br> Born as a three-star hotel in 1964, it has undergone numerous expansions and modernizations until it achieved the four-star classification in 1996, remaining the only hotel of this category in Scanno. The facility was managed continuously until a few years ago and is currently in good general condition, although it requires system updates and partial but not structural renovation work. <br></br> The accommodation capacity reaches up to 90 beds, distributed in single, double, triple, quadruple rooms and suites/apartments. <br></br> The Garden Hotel also has large common areas: reception, hall, bar, restaurant rooms, professional kitchen, breakfast room, games and entertainment rooms, industrial laundry and technical rooms. The restaurant area can accommodate up to 300 people between the restaurant and the atrium. There is also a private car park with 25-30 spaces, also accessible to buses. <br></br> Among the outdoor spaces, there is a panoramic garden on two levels, terraces, balconies, and a small terrace/solarium. The property is located in a strategic position, adjacent to the public gardens and well connected to the main services, schools and public transport. The historic center can be reached on foot in a few minutes. <br></br> Thanks to its versatility, the property lends itself to numerous alternative uses: tourist residence, retirement home for self-sufficient elderly people, health residence, wellness center or SPA, apartment complex for sale or rent."
